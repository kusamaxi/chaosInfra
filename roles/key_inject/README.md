This Ansible script is used to inject keys into a Polkadot node. Key injection is an essential part of setting up a node to enable it to participate in the network consensus, validate transactions, and perform other important tasks. In the Polkadot ecosystem, there are different types of keys that serve specific purposes. Some common key types are:

Session keys: Responsible for authoring blocks and participating in the consensus process.
Controller keys: Used to control the stake of the validator or nominator.
Stash keys: Used to hold the funds for staking.
The key injection process in this script is performed through a series of steps:

First, the script retrieves the public key corresponding to the provided private key. This is done using the parity.chain.subkey_inspect method and specifying the cryptographic scheme (defaulting to sr25519).

Next, the script checks whether the public key is already present in the keystore by sending a POST request with the author_hasKey method to the node's RPC endpoint. If the key is already present, the script proceeds to the next step, otherwise, it retries up to 12 times with a delay of 10 seconds between each attempt.

If the key is not found in the keystore, the script proceeds to inject the key into the node using the author_insertKey method, sending another POST request to the RPC endpoint. After successful key injection, the script sends a notification to restart the service.

Finally, the script displays the results of the key injection process, showing whether the key has been successfully injected or not.

The key injection process is crucial in the Polkadot ecosystem as it allows nodes to securely participate in network consensus and other critical tasks. Injecting the appropriate keys enables the node to act as a validator, nominator, or collator, contributing to the overall security and stability of the network.
